	<h3>Welcome to FrontEndFlux, a Frontend Developerâ€™s Learning Journey</h3>
	<p>
		Hey there! Iâ€™m FrontEndFlux, a self-taught frontend developer
		documenting my journey as I learn, build, and experiment with web
		technologies. This blog is my open notebookâ€”where I share what Iâ€™ve
		learned, the challenges Iâ€™ve faced, and the little wins along the way.
		If youâ€™re also on a path to becoming a frontend developer, I hope you
		find these posts helpful, relatable, or at least a bit entertaining.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe in learning in publicâ€”sharing my thoughts, projects, and
		mistakes so that others can learn from them too. Whether itâ€™s
		understanding JavaScript concepts, experimenting with CSS animations, or
		diving into frameworks like Astro, Iâ€™ll be posting my insights, code
		snippets, and reflections. Expect hands-on tutorials, project
		breakdowns, and personal thoughts on the learning process.
	</p>

	<p>
		This space isnâ€™t just for meâ€”itâ€™s for anyone interested in frontend
		development, whether youâ€™re a beginner like me or a seasoned developer
		willing to share advice. Feel free to connect with me on [Bluesky
		Username] and join the conversation. Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow
		together! ðŸš€
	</p>
