	<h2>Building with Astro</h2>
	<p>
		As I delve into the world of frontend coding to complement my graphic
		design skills, this website serves as my dynamic playground, evolving
		alongside my learning journey. Expect continuous changes and
		enhancements as I find my footing in the world of web development.
	</p>

	<p>
		In due course, I'll be introducing a blog sectionâ€”a space where I share
		insights gained along the way. Some posts will be personal notes,
		serving as valuable references for me in the future, and hopefully,
		offering a helping hand to others venturing into the same territory.
	</p>

	<!-- <p>
		Feel free to connect with me on X (formerly Twitter) or drop me an
		email; I always appreciate engaging conversations. For those who enjoy a
		more social touch, take a peek at my musical preferences on Last.FM. It
		might just be the perfect conversation starterâ€”we can dive into the
		world of music.
	</p> -->

	<!-- <p>
		In the pipeline, there's an exciting project brewing: a mixtape site set
		to launch before my portfolio site.
